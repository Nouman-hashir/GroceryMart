ðŸ›’ GroceryMart â€” Flutter Grocery App
GroceryMart is a modern Flutter application developed as part of the MUST Company Flutter Intern Assessment. This project demonstrates essential e-commerce app features with a focus on clean architecture, reusable UI components, and persistent cart data â€” all without using a backend.
